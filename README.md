# MakersBnB group challenge
Week 5 of Makers Academy challenge to build a web application that allows users to list spaces they have available, and to hire spaces for the night.
Our Group is called FAMM and consists of Annabelle, Margarida, Francesco and Michael. 


----
Headline specifications
----
* Any signed-up user can list a new space.
* Users can list multiple spaces.
* Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.
* Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available.
* Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the user that owns that space.
* Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book that space.
* Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night.
